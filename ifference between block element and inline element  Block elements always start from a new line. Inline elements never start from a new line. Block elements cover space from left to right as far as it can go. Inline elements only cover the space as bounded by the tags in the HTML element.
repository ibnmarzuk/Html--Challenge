#Difference between block element and inline element

Block elements always start from a new line. 
Inline elements never start from a new line. 
Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element

inline
<p><em>An emphasized paragraph.</em></p>
<p><em>Another emphasized paragraph.</em></p>
